    Ricardo Felgueiras is an engineering manager with more than 12 years of experience in developing (mostly) web applications. He has worked in several areas, particularly in education, banking and e-commerce area.

    In the last years, he has been focused mainly on managing teams by acting as a mentor and a coach.

    The recipe for a great team is composed of 3 different ingredients with equal parts:
    - Motivated people - core ingredient to success;
    - Get things done - push things live as in it’s better live than perfect;
    - Great technical knowledge - pretty much self-explanatory.
