Welcome to my humble blog. 

I'm Bruno Costa, a software developer from Portugal and this is my little corner on the internet. Here I share some of my thoughts.

<b>What do I do for living?</b>

I don't know about you, but when someone outside the field ask me what I do for living, I know, in that instant, that what I'm about to tell that person and nothing is almost the same. Most of the times I freeze for a second but then I say "I'm a software developer.". The expression in the person's face is 'something'. "Oh, that's cool.", which translating it to English means, "I've no idea what is it.". And the next question is almost the same, "So, what does it mean?"

<b>Answer</b>

I do applications, website, that stuff.

And the other person is still the same and I'm thinking that I should try to find an answer that makes software development looks sexy. 

<b>What do I do for living?</b>

I'm a software developer, you may not know what is it, but I do love software development, I think it's amazing in every forms. Writing code is like an art, it's like creating a new piece of melody, painting the picture of what want to build in your mind or writing a book. Every single line of code is something unique when it comes from someone that loves programming. Years of practice, trying a new technology or with a better design. Thinking about scalability, performance and code maintenance... always trying to do a better melody than the one before.

Think about Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Linkedin, etc... Million of unknown artists giving you art, everyday.

I'm a software developer. I'm an artist.
