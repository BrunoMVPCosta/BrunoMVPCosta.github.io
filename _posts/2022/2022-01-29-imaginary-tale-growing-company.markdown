While I was creating a blog post about how to speed up engineering teams to deliver more value to the end-user, a friend of mine shared an idea: linking that story to a different one I was planning to write and taking the opportunity to use the same fictional characters.

I really loved the idea, so I’ve decided to link not only those two stories but also try to create a set of stories for a growing company. 

Technology companies tend to grow in different directions, and the stories I will be sharing are related to my personal view on what approach should be taken. I will speak about processes, people, and technology. 

The name of the company is thrownewexception.com. It is a technology company, because, well, what company isn’t nowadays, right? The product is about content, creating content, and selling ads without taking advantage of the users’ data because we respect privacy. The CTO is Enzo, an experienced executive that helped other companies succeed. He hired Samuel as VP of technology, who is helping him set up the company to be recognized as one of the best tech companies to work on.

There will probably be more people joining the story as I write it, but for now, I would like to introduce you to the very first article of the company.
