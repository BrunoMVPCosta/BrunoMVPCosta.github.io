So, I was thinking it would be cool if there was a game to learn Ruby.
Games are good for learning, because the more interesting the material is, the more likely it will be retained.

I found the *Ruby Warrior*.

It's a fun game. Although, to be totally honest, the music is kind of annoying, but the good news is that you can turn it off.
