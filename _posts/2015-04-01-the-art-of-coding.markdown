When someone outside the field asks me what I do for a living, I know that what I'm about to say to that person and  nothing is pretty much the same. If you are a software engineer, you may have experienced the same thing in the past. It doesn't have to do with the person, but I couldn't find an expression to transform software development in a sexy activity. Let's be honest, you have plenty of cool TV shows about doctors (House, Grey Anatomy, etc), about lawyers (Suits, How to get away with murderer, etc), about detectives, policemen, etc. But about software engineering we don't have much and the ones that exist, I think only software related staff watches them.

If it's hard for someone as creative as a TV shows writer, how to answer the question with some glamour and creativity?

<b>What do I do for living?</b>

I'm a software developer, you may not know what is it, but I do love software development, I think it's amazing in every way. Writing code is like an art, it's like creating a new piece of melody, painting the picture of what you want to build in your mind or writing a book. Every single line of code is something unique when it comes from someone that loves programming. Years of practice, trying a new technology or with a better design. Thinking about scalability, performance and code maintenance... always trying to do a better melody than the one before.

Think about Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Linkedin, etc... Millions of unknown artists giving you art, everyday.

I'm a software developer. I'm an artist.
