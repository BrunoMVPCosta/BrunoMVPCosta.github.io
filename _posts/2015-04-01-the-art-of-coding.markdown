Have you even felt it's really hard to explain what a software engineer does for living? Have you even felt boring someone explaining what a software engineer does? If you have answer yes for any of the questions, welcome to the club.

When I started studying computer engineering, here in Portugal, not everyone had a personal computer and a lot of people not much older than me, had real issues working with computers. For example, they didn't know how to turn on the computer. Yeah! That much.

Back on those days, trying to explain to a friend, what I was studying was really hard, not only because I had to idea what software engineering exactly was, but also, because [programming have so many negative stereotype][1] and for a bunch of reasons, a lot of people just don't enjoy to be around a software engineer or a someone with a nerd personality. I felt that people that didn't know me that well, looked at me differently after I told what I was studying and I sincerely believe it was because of the stereotypes around software engineers. Those stereotypes create a barrier on the communication between people and you need more time to get the "normal" look from those people again.

I feel sad because of it, but I think it doesn't have to do with the other person, but we cannot find an expression to transform software development in a non-boring activity. Let's be honest, you have plenty of cool TV shows about doctors (House, Grey Anatomy, etc), about lawyers (Suits, How to get away with murderer, etc), about detectives, policemen, etc. But about software engineering we don't have much and the ones that exist, I think only software related staff watches them. It's boring.

If it's hard for someone as creative as a TV shows writer, how to answer the question with some glamour and creativity?

<b>What do we do for living?</b>

We are software engineers. Some of us create apps, others backend services to support those apps or websites. Think about Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Linkedin, etc... million of people using their technology day after day. Isn't it amazing? Does it look boring? Changing people life. Changing the world. Changing the way people communicate. Changing the way people buy. Writing code is an art. It might not be one-person show as it is creating a new piece of melody or writing a book, but it is art. Art created by one or million of software engineers.

Again, think about Facebook, Skype, Twitter, Linkedin, etc... Millions of unknown artists... giving you art, everyday.

Does it sounds boring? I don't think so.
